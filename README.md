This Python script generates an SVG clock using NiceGUI, displaying the current time. The clock design was adapted from [Station_Clock.svg on Wikipedia](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Station_Clock.svg).

## Description

This script showcases the integration of NiceGUI to create a real-time SVG clock. The clock's design is inspired by traditional station clocks and visually represents the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds. The script utilizes NiceGUI to provide a clean and intuitive graphical user interface for displaying the clock.
